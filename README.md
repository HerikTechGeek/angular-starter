# Angular Boilerplate
Quickly bootstrap the app in modular style design pattern.


### Install
* Clone Project
* run ```npm install``` which will get all dev dependencies.
* run ```bower install``` which will get all project dependencies.

### Execute
* run ```gulp create_symlinks```
* run ```gulp watch_debug``` - this will update CSS whenever you change anything in any of the .scss files, so you always get updated CSS in browser.
* run ```app_run.bat debug``` in another command prompt.

Still improving the boilerplate code. Will keep updating it.
Suggestions are always welcome.
